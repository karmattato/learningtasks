      <p>Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>240 g Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>100 g Cocoa Powder</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pour the condensed into a pot and start cooking. Stir till it boils, when it starts bubbling lightly with foams, you should take it off the gas so it doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Sift in the cocoa powder 3 times. Then pour the pure cocoa powder (no sugar) into the milk while it's still hot. Mix.</li>
        <li>Sift the second time after the cocoa is almost well-mixed. Keep mixing.</li>
	  <li>Sift the rest of the cocoa powder in. The mixture should be pretty thick by now.</li>
	  <li>After mixing all the cocoa, the mixture should harden a bit, but still kinda soft. Put it in a plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for 2-3 hours before continuing.</li>
	  <li>After putting the chocolate in the fridge, it will harden and should be easier to cut and shape.</li>
	  <li>Remember to spread some cocoa powder underneath before cutting it. Cut into even pieces, cut about 15g per piece (size is for preference only).</li>
	  <li>Sift some cocoa powder on top to prevent sticking while shaping. Normally truffles are shaped as circles because it's quick and easy (shape it however you want).</li>
	  <li>After shaping, wrap them up nicely or eat it as you're done. If the cocoa powder falls off you can sift some on it again. ENJOY!</li>
